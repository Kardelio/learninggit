===========================================
======= Welcome to the GIT tutorial =======
===========================================

NOTE: We are using digital instructions in order to save some trees

Below are the tasks that you will need to complete one after the other in order to complete this git tutorial session and fully understand the git commands.

At the end of this file are a collection of links and more advanced hints that can be followed in order to read more about git, continue to practice git in different settings and ofcourse to sure up what you have learnt today...

Good Luck!

P.S.
If you have an issue connecting to github because of shopdirects network then you can try these two commands to fix it:

git config --global http.proxy http://ipv4.195.59.45.40.webdefence.global.blackspider.com:8081
git config --global https.proxy http://ipv4.195.59.45.40.webdefence.global.blackspider.com:8081

================ Tasks ====================
===========================================

1. If you are reading this then you have already completed task one which is to clone the repository onto your own machine using the command:
	git clone https://github.com/kardelio/learninggit.git
You then hopefully CD'd into it by typing:
	cd learninggit

2. Now that you have the 'code' (a copy of the repo) you can edit it however you like, however before you do run the command:
	git status
and what do you see?
You can also list the files inside the terminal if you like by using:
	ls
but maybe you prefer to look at the files and folders in the explorer or in finder.... Up to you?

3.Now open the file called 'data.txt' in whatever text editor you like (maybe notepad, vscode, notepad++ or vim ooo) and fill in your name in the space, today's date in the space and at the bottom insert your favourite joke or just any old joke! Save the file!

4. Now run that:
	git status
command again... What do you see? What has changed?

5. Now use the command:
	git add .
(yes there is a fullstop at the end, dont forget it!)
This takes your changes from the working directory and puts them in the staging area, the fullstop simply means 'ALL CHANGES PLEASE' so git will take all of them.

6. Now again use the:
	git status
command and see what the result is. The git status command is a really good one to constantly check the status of your changes. Its like a sanity check.

7. Before we can use the next command (the committ command) we have to tell git who we are, as part of gits power comes from the fact that it attaches an author to committs so you can see who did what and when, this is really simply it is just two seperate commands:
	git config -–global user.name YOUR_GITHUB_USER
	git config -–global user.email YOUR_GITHUB_EMAIL
please replace the bits in the capital letters to match those of your own GITHUB account information! (you only need to do this bit once, the computer will remember it for all future needs)

8. Finally use this command:
(obviously change the bit in the speech marks to be your message)
	git commit -m "insert your message here"
This is the all important SAVE action, the commit action that saves your all your changes that are in the 'staging area' to a commit and logs it into the commit history for all time! And just to be sure use the:
	git status
command one more time and see what happens?
IF you typed 'git commit' with no message at the end, DONT PANIC, git has opened vi (a text editor) and is asking you directly for the message. You can type the following to get out of this... (type it as you see it <Esc> is escape key...)
<Esc> : q ! <Enter>
after you are free, please try the original commit command again, with a message this time!

9. Now use the command
	git log
and see the history of the repo and see all the previous committs, and notice the top entry... Its YOURS! You have contributed to this project, however the changes are only on your machine at the moment, lets look at how you can upload/submit them to the server!

10. Ok sooooo, in the last set of tasks you committed your changes directly to the master branch. THIS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA and the best practises would instead get you to make your own 'BRANCH' and change the code in there first, then you can re-join your branch back to master after a Pull Request for example or someone else checking over your code at least. So in the next few tasks you will make your own branch and practice what we did before AGAIN... Repetition, repetition, repetition...
11. You are currently in the master branch to see this for yourself use the command:
	git branch
and it will display a list of branches that are on your machine and place a asterik next to the one that you are IN.

12. Ok no use the command:
	git branch YOUR_INITIALS_branch
Please replace the capital "YOUR_INITIALS" with your initials...Please...
This will now have created a brand new branch for you to safely work in. However we are NOT inside that branch yet, it has only created it for us, not changed us into it... Use the
	git branch
command to see exactly that, your new branch and master, but the asterisk is still pointing at master!

13. Use the command:
	git checkout YOUR_INITIALS_branch
The "YOUR_INITIALS_branch" should match the EXACT name that you just called your newly created branch before in task 12!
This will finally change you safely into your created branch and you can ofcourse do
	git branch
to check exactly that and see the asterisk next to your branch and not master! NOW you are safe to mess around with whatever you like in here and it wont effect master (it wont effect your production code, depending on your branching stratey... more later...) 

14. Now you will need to re-use steps 5 - 8 to complete this task.
Your objective is to create a new file called whatever you like and inside the file write simply what you had for lunch today!
Its that simple... Create a file inside the repo and in it tell us what you had for lunch. You will need to ADD and COMMITT these changes once you are happy with them.
(Use 'git add' & 'git commit' to help you do this).Once you have done this STOP and wait to learn about pushing your changes to the server for everyone to enjoy...

**********
**********
BREAK - - 
**********
**********

15. Use the command:
	git push origin your_branch_name
(obviously change the 'your_branch_name' to match the name of the branch you created and have been working on)
so this will push (upload) your work to the server and create a branch that matches yours on the server's version of the repo. So you code will be in the cloud but not in master. This is normal and we would then create a pull request which we will cover later in order to get your branch code into master... Once it has been OK'd.
FYI Origin is just a nickname for the server that git gives it, as its quicker than writing out the entire url again...

**********

BREAK - -

16. Last one... I would like you finally now to create a PR (Pull Request) for your branch to be 'pulled' into master!
So that would mean that after review your changes would be added to the coded in master.
To do this go to github.com and log in as your created account.
Once in github.com use the search bar or the side panel to find the online repository called "learninggit" made by Kardelio.
Once there you will hopefully (if you follow step 15) see your branch in a yellow bar with a green button that reads "Compare & Pull Request". Click it.
Inside the next page write a message to say what your new changes do... and then hit the big green button that reads "Create Pull Request"...
ONE LUCKY CONTESTANT WILL HAVE THEIR CODE PR'D AND PULLED INTO MASTER IN THE SESSION..... Could it be you!??!

Now sit back and relax and enjoy that last few bits of the session...
Please prepare any questions you have...

================ Hints ====================
===========================================

HEAD is a reference to the last commit in the currently checked-out branch. HEAD is a reference to the last commit in the currently checked-out branch.

To remove your current commit from the history, use: 'git reset --hard HEAD~1' this moves your HEAD away from the current commit backwards by one, to before that commit, the lost commit is now in the reflog and gone from our usual repo.

Use git commit –amend followed by any changes, to edit the last commit you made, e.g. git commit –amend –m ‘new message’

Use git log --pretty --oneline –graph often to see the lay of the land and understand the relationship between your branches and merges.

Git reflog will give you a list of lost commits that can be brought back to life by starting a new brach with them like so: git branch desired_name short_hash_num 

To delete a branch use: git branch –D branch_name
